# 🅿️ ParkingSpot-ML

**ParkingSpot-ML** is a project that uses **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision** to detect and classify parking spaces in video streams.  
The goal is to support more efficient parking management by determining the status of each parking space: **vacant** or **occupied**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Model used**: SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- **Input**: Video footage from surveillance cameras
- **Output**: Location of parking spaces and their status (empty/occupied)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Real-time parking slot detection and classification
- Display the number of available and occupied parking spots
- Easy integration with existing monitoring systems

---

## 🧠 Dataset

- The full dataset includes:
  - Raw video of a parking lot
  - Region-of-interest (mask) image
  - Labeled image dataset of `empty` and `not_empty` parking slots

🚫 **Note**: The original video file `parking_lot.mp4` is too large to be included here.  
You can download it from the following Google Drive link:
